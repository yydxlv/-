Modeling species¡¯ geographic distributions is an important problem in conservation biology.
In this example we model the geographic distribution of two south American mammals given past observations
and 14 environmental variables. Since we have only positive examples (there are no unsuccessful observations),
we cast this problem as a density estimation problem and use the OneClassSVM provided by the package sklearn.svm as our modeling tool.
The dataset is provided by Phillips et. al. (2006). If available, the example uses basemap to plot the coast lines
and national boundaries of South America.

The two species are:

¡°Bradypus variegatus¡± , the Brown-throated Sloth.
¡°Microryzomys minutus¡± , also known as the Forest Small Rice Rat, a rodent that lives in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.
