This example aims at showing characteristics of different clustering algorithms on datasets that are ¡°interesting¡±
but still in 2D.
The last dataset is an example of a ¡®null¡¯ situation for clustering: the data is homogeneous, and there is no good clustering.

While these examples give some intuition about the algorithms, this intuition might not apply to very high dimensional data.

The results could be improved by tweaking the parameters for each clustering strategy,
